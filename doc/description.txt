Scooter is an extensible 3D modelling platform. The word "patform"
here is the keyword. Scooter was created with focus on studying
connectivity properties of 3D meshes and at present moment it has an
implementation of (hopefully) innovative data structure, allowing
compact representation of non-manifold 3D meshes. The rest of the
implementation is built around that idea and represents a VRML viewer,
3D mesh editor and in the future a platform for running various
algorithms on the 3D meshes. Scooter is a direct continuation of one 
of my academic projects. I am releasing this project to the public
domain under GPL. The current source code snapshot is available at
http://wassist.cs.technion.ac.il/~dimka/scooter/scooter-0.0.1.575.tar.gz
Scooter is developed on Windows with future port to Linux in mind.
