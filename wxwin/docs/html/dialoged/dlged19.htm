<H2>Multi-platform development</H2>
<P>
<TT>.wxr</TT> files generated on one environment (e.g. Windows) can be used in another (e.g. GTK).
If you use default fonts and colouring (set <B>useSystemDefaults</B> to True in the dialog properties)
then the dialog fonts and colours will take on the native values, rather than ones specified in the
resource. Without this, colours in the dialog resource may not match system colours.<P>
Also, set <B>useDialogUnits</B> to True whenever possible since this will cause the dialog
to be created using a scale based on the current system font size, and will result in dialogs that are
portable between screen resolutions as well as platforms.<P>
Because the same control can have different sizes on different GUIs,
the user should be cautious in assuming that one resource file will work for all
platforms. It may be better to plan to conditionally include or load different
resource files for different platforms, with spacing modified to suit each
environment. The best thing is to try your dialog resource on several platforms
and see whether tweaking is required for some platforms.<P>
