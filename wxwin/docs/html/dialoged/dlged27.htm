<H2>What needs to be done for XView and Motif</H2>
<P>
The following areas need attention before Dialog Editor will run properly on these platforms.<P>
<OL>

<LI> For XView, the property editor needs to be made a modeless, not modal dialog, which has
implications for flow of control in wxPropertyInfo::Edit.
<LI> Properties which do not return the same value they are set to, such as width and height,
need to be stored directly in wxItemResource and <I>not</I> transferred from window to wxItemResource
in wxWindowPropertyInfo::InstantiateResource.
<LI> Properties which cannot be dynamically set in XView or Motif need to have the item recreated (e.g. labelOrientation).
</OL>
