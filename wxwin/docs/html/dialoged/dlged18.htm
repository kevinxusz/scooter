<H2>Working with identifiers</H2>
<P>
Dialog Editor keeps track of identifiers in your resources, and reads and writes an include file of the
form <TT>name.h</TT> where 'name' is the root name of your <TT>.wxr</TT> file. Dialog Editor
knows about the predefined identifiers such as wxID_OK.<P>
When you create a dialog or control, the identifier is initially generated. When you
edit the identifier via a property editor, you can choose a new name, such as a predefined
symbol and optionally change the integer assigned to the name (assuming it's not a
predefined symbol).<P>
When you save the project, the identifier include file is saved as well. Include this file
in your project so that you can refer to controls and dialogs by identifier rather than
obscure integers. Note that the <TT>.wxr</TT> file itself can only contain integer ids and not the symbols,
due to way in which the resource file is loaded.<P>
