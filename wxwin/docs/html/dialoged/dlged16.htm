<H2>Using property editors</H2>
<P>
Property editors consist of a list of properties and current values, plus controls at the top of
the editor. If the property is of an appropriate type, you can edit the value directly in the
text field, and confirm or cancel the value using the two buttons to the left of it.
If the property has a predefined range of values, such as labelFontFamily, you can
see a list of permissable values by clicking on the button labelled with an ellipsis symbol (<B>...</B>).
This will show a listbox with possible values and current selection. You may also be able
to cycle through values by double-clicking the value in the listbox.<P>
Properties may have special editors appropriate to the type. Filename properties invoke
the file selector, and properties containing list of user-definable strings use a
string editor.<P>
When you change a property value, this value is immediately reflected in
the dialog or control.  If the item allows this value to be changed
dynamically, the relevant wxWindows function will be called internally
to effect the change.  If the value cannot be changed dynamically, the
item will be destroyed and re-created, which means that there will be
more flickering associated with some kinds of property changes than
others.<P>
