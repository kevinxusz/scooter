<H2>Resource associations</H2>
<P>
wxItemResource objects (containing information about panel items and dialogs) are not visual
objects. However, they need to be associated with the visual objects when the latter
are created for editing purposes. Therefore there is a hash table called resourceAssociations
in wxResourceManager. When a window is created, the resource pointer and window pointer
are associated via the hash table. When the window is deleted, the association is removed.
Children of a dialog are associated with child wxItemResource objects by calling
wxFindWindowByName with the wxItemResource name.<P>
