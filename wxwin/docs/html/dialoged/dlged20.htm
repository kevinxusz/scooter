<H2>Converting old files</H2>
<P>
Dialog Editor can make an attempt at converting dialog resources created with Dialog Editor for wxWindows 1.68.
The command is <B>Convert Old Resources...</B> on the <B>File</B> menu.<P>
You need to specify two directories, an input and an output directory. Dialog Editor will
do the following conversions:<P>
<OL>

<LI> wxMultiText becomes a wxTextCtrl with wxTE_MULTILINE style.
<LI> wxText becomes a wxTextCtrl.
<LI> wxMessage becomes either a wxStaticText or wxStaticBitmap.
<LI> wxButton becomes a wxBitmapButton if necessary.
<LI> wxGroupBox becomes wxStaticBox.
<LI> Controls that no longer have labels, such as wxTextCtrl and wxListBox,
have a separate wxStaticText control created for them at approximately the correct
position. The label's window name becomes ControlName_Label where ControlName is
the name of the control that formerly had the label.
<LI> Identifiers are allocated.
<LI> Font sizes are reduced to counter the decreased font size now created by wxWindows
for a given point size.
<LI> The dialog height is reduced slightly to compensate for the fact that the dialog caption
is no longer included in the size.
